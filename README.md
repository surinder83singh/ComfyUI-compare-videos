# 📽️ Compare Videos – ComfyUI Extension

**Compare Videos** is a custom [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) extension that enables wipe-style comparisons between two sequences of images (representing videos). It is especially useful for visual evaluation of image/video generation pipelines, before-and-after comparisons, and frame-by-frame analysis.
